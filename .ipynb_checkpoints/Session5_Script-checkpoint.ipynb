    "Reduce, however, has some slight nuances. It needs to be imported from functools, and remember that we do not need to wrap it in a list as we are only expecting a single value to be returned. You will also notice that, in this example, we have includes a print command in the function so that we can see that it is called once for each element in our list. This is not needed, but it helps to demonstrate that reduce is iterating over each element, calling red_sum repeatedly. --run code--"
