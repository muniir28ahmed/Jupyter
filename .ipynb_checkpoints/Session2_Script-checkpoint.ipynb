Functions are used to tell Python to perform a certain thing and the function name - print in this case - is usually a good clue as to what that thing is. When we tell Python to run a function, we say the function is being called. So in the code above, we call the print function. Most functions need some data to operate on. The data are sent to the function in what are known as arguments. Arguments appear inside round brackets after the name of the function being called. In the examples above, we passed one argument to the print function. That was the message to be printed.\n",

    "Here we created a variable called years and assigned to it the value 10. Python took this to be a number so when we multiplied it by 2, we got the answer 20 as expected. In the next row, we assigned the string value one-oh to our variable called years. The quotation marks indicate it is a string. Now when we print years times 2, we see the string one-oh one-oh - which is the years string printed twice. So in Python, the operations you perform on your variables can depend on the data types the variables store.\n",

    "The basic data types in Python are strings, which we have already met, integers, which are whole numbers like 10, floating point numbers, known as floats, which have a decimal point, for example, 3.5 or 0.1, and Boolean values which can be either true or false.\n",

So if I say years equals 10, then years will be an integer but if I say years equals 10 point 5 then it will be a float. Wrapping a literal value in quotation marks makes it a string. Each of these types has a name that Python uses to identify it. For strings, it is str, that is s-t-r, for integers, it is int, for floating point numbers it is float, and for Boolean values, it is bool. Python has a function called type, which takes one argument and tells you the data type of whatever you pass to it. Python also has one function for each of the data types I just listed, which converts the value passed to it into its named type. For example, the function called str converts whatever you pass to it into a string.\n",

Remember that all functions take an argument list that is encloded in round brackets. We only want to pass one argument to the function, so we enclose that in round brackets. Let's try with an integer first. We can pass it a literal or a variable."

A few functions, like print, for example, are used to tell Python to perform some operation - printing to the screen in that case. Most, however, are used to perform some kind of calculation and to provide the result of doing so. The other functions we have used so far, including type and int are like that. We say that they return a value. The function called int returns a value that is the integer representation of the argument that you pass to it. The function called type returns something that describes the type of the argument you pass to it. So functions accept arguments and return a result."

Every time you assign a value to a variable of a simple data type like that, it uses a new location in memory, regardless of whether or not you have a variable with that name already. For example, if we start with a variable called age and give it the value 10 and we then want to add one to it then we can type this"

    "Behind the scenes, Python grabs a new piece of memory and stores the value 10 there when the first line is run. Then, when it gets to the second line, it grabs another new piece of memory and stores the value 11 there. It no longer uses the first value, where age was 10 - that is discarded, so when we use the variable called age, we get the value 11. We describe this quality whereby variables are not overwritten, but are instead assigned in a new part of memory by saying a variable is immutable. Right now, none of the consequences of this will be obvious, but as we go on through the course, they will start to make themselves felt, so we should start now but at least mentioning the idea that simple data types are immutable. Later we will meet data types that are mutable (they are changed in situ) and start to understand why this distinction is important.\n",

I imagine you are wondering why it matters. A lot of the time, it doesn't, but occasionally, it does, and so you need to know what we mean when we talk about mutability later."
